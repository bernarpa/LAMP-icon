LAMP icon for Ubuntu 10.04
--------------------------

This program is a tray icon that allows you to start/stop Apache and MySQL with
a single mouse click. It's specifically taylored upon Ubuntu 10.04, most likely
it won't work elsewhere without modifications of the commands to start, stop
and check the status of the services.

It works for the Apache and MySQL packages bundled with Ubuntu itself.

To use it effectively you should add /usr/bin/lamp-icon to your desktop's
autostart programs.
